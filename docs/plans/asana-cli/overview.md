# Asana CLI Tool Implementation Plan

## Executive Summary

Building a command-line interface tool to interact with Asana's project management platform, enabling engineers to manage tasks and projects directly from the terminal without switching context to a web browser. This tool will integrate seamlessly into developer workflows, supporting automation, scripting, and batch operations.

## Business Value

- **Developer Productivity**: Eliminates context switching between terminal and browser
- **Automation Capability**: Enables CI/CD integration and scripted workflows
- **Team Efficiency**: Bulk operations and templates reduce repetitive work
- **Accessibility**: Provides keyboard-only interface for power users

## Technical Overview

A Rust-based CLI application that communicates with Asana's REST API v1.0, featuring secure token management, intelligent caching, and multiple output formats. The tool follows Unix philosophy principles while providing modern conveniences like fuzzy matching and natural language date parsing.

## Phase Status

- Phase 1: Foundation and Setup - State: `_in_review_`
- Phase 2: Core API Client - State: `_done_`
- Phase 3: Project Operations - State: `_done_`
- Phase 4: Task Operations - State: `_todo_`
- Phase 5: Polish and Release - State: `_todo_`

## Success Criteria

- Complete CRUD operations for tasks and projects
- Sub-200ms response time for cached operations
- 80% test coverage with mocked API responses
- Zero plaintext token exposure
- Cross-platform support (macOS, Linux, Windows)

## Timeline

Estimated completion: 3-4 weeks
- Week 1: Phases 1-2 (Foundation + API Client)
- Week 2: Phases 3-4 (Project + Task Operations)
- Week 3-4: Phase 5 (Polish + Release)

## Stakeholders

- **Owner**: Engineering Team
- **Users**: Developers, DevOps, Technical Project Managers
- **External Dependencies**: Asana API (rate limits: 150/1500 req/min)
